            <div>To which the stranger (by name M. Hercule Poirot) had made a fitting reply including the phrase - "But indeed, do I not remember that once you saved my life?"</div>

            <p>As to what it had all been about, Lieutenant Dubosc was still in the dark, but to him had been delegated the duty of seeing off M. Poirot by the Taurus Express, and he was carrying it out with all the zeal and ardour befitting a young officer with a promising career ahead of him. <br>

            <p>It was not the first time he had made this observation. Conversations on the platform, before the departure of a train, are apt to be somewhat repetitive in character. </p>

    <div class="right-down">
            <p>A cold wind came whistling down the platform. Both men shivered. Lieutenant Dubosc managed to cast a surreptitious glance at his watch. Five minutes to five - only five minutes more! </p>

        <div>The Wagon Lit conductor had come up to the two men. The train was about to depart, he said. Monsieur had better mount. The little man removed his hat. </div>
